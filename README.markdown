PieCrust
========

PieCrust is a static website generator and lightweight CMS that's all managed
with text files. No complex setup, databases, or administrative panels. Simple,
beautiful, and yummy.

For more information, along with the complete documentation, visit [the official
website](http://bolt80.com/piecrust/).

If you want to quickly give it a spin, from the root directory, run `_piecrust/chef
serve website`. It should start your default browser and show you the sample
website. You can then edit files and see what changes, and finally run `_piecrust/chef
bake website` to generate the final static website, which you'll find in `website/_counter`.
