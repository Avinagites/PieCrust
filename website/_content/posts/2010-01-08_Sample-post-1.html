title: I'm thinking of writing a website engine
---
Lately I've been looking at some of my most simple personal website thinking how custom handmade HTML would be too tedious to write,
but using a fully fledged web framework would be overkill. I looked at some solutions like [Stacey] or [Jekyll] which are great but
don't quite fit my requirements or workflow. I ended up using this as a lame excuse to procrastinate and not actually work on whatever
website I wanted to build, instead starting writing a lightweight website engine.

So here is PieCrust!
